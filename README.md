# Instructions
Go to releases and download the latest of either hp8fix.zip or hp8NonEAAPPversion.zip depending on which version you need to use.

If using the hp8fix.zip extract the d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini files into your game folder next to the hp8.exe file and you are good to go!

If using the hp8NonEAAPPversion.zip extract the d3d9.dll, d3d9.ini and fps.dll files into your game folder next to the hp8.exe file and you are good to go!

You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d9.ini file.

This game seems to have issues if its not installed on the default path in your C drive so make sure its installed there. sometimes you may need to right click the whole game file, uncheck read only, and then go to security tab and check all of the security permissons. Make sure that your exe has not previously been hex edited and is a fresh clean exe for the game. 

# Aspect Ratio
This is ONLY AVAILABLE in the hp8fix.zip. The default for aspect ratio is (0) which is 16:9, choose out of the other aspect ratios available to use by changing (0) to the number that’s correct for you.

# FPS
The default for FPS is (60) you can change it as you wish or fully uncap it with (0) with the FPSLimit option in the d3d9.ini file. This games max FPS is 60 as going above this breaks many major parts of the game.

# FOV
The default for FOV is (1) which is on, you can turn this off in the d3d9.ini by changing the (1) to (0).
