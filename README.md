# hp-Deathly-Hallows-Part-2-Fix-
This is the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 d3d9 wrapper.

simply go to releases and download the hp8fix.zip or  hp8NonEAAPPversion.zip  depending on your version of the game put the d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini into your game folder next to the game exe and your good to go

you can edit settings in d3d9.ini

aspect ratio by default is 0 which is 16:9 as origionally but we added some more options for aspect ratio in the ini.

Default for FPS cap is 60 you can change it as you like or uncap with 0 (IMPORTANT- we have fully tested the game at 60fps and above, 60fps works perfectly but anything above 60 is broken) highly suggest leaving the cap to 60 or it will break.

Default for fov is 1 (on) you can turn it off in the ini with fov = 0 (off) this will set FOV to its default value. this setting is only on or off in this fix.
