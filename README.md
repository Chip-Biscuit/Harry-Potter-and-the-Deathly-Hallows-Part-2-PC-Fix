# hp-Deathly-Hallows-Part-2-Fix-
This is the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 d3d9 wrapper which is based from 13AG d3d9.dll wrapper.

https://github.com/ThirteenAG/d3d9-wrapper

simply put the d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini into your game folder next to the game exe and your good to go

you can edit settings in d3d9.ini

Default for FPS cap is 60 you can change it as you like or uncap with 0 (IMPORTANT- we have fully tested the game at 60fps and above, 60fps works perfectly but anything above 60 is broken) highly suggest leaving the cap to 60 or it will break.

[this fix as it stands is a beta and the game is still being looked into, we are looking into capping the menus to 30fps so they dont run so fast. Future updates will be posted so keep an eye out]
